[1]Two Sum

[1][1]first try, pure brutal-force, no optimizations

[1][2]first make the array sorted, use two pointers that point two ends of the array and move towards each other

[2]Add Two Numbers

[2][1]simple high-percise addition, using linked list

[2][2]not my own idea, precise in code, but not memory-efficient

[3]Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

[3][1]idea is nice: sliding window with aggregating length, but wonder why is both time and space inefficient

[3][2]using container in std lib: set, much more preciser, but still not time&space-efficient

[3][3]not my own idea, using a hashmap that maintain the position of each character in string, with the ASCII code of the character as one of its keys
